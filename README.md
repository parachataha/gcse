# Welcome to Restaurant Ordering App
This is my (gcse) school work for making a python terminal app using loops and conditions

The project is a sequence of print statements welcoming you to "Deliver-Roar". The user then gets asked a series of inputs to select a desired restaurant, and then order items from the specific menu. Each item has a specific price and the order receipt is shown with prices. Then the totalCost is calculated and outputted.
